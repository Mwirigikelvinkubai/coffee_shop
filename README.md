# Coffee Shop Domain Modeling

## Overview

This project models a Coffee Shop domain using Python and object-oriented programming.  
It includes three main entities:
- **Customer*#
- **Coffee**
- **Order**

The relationships:
- A Customer can place many Orders.
- A Coffee can have many Orders.
- An Order belongs to one Customer and one Coffee.

The code implements:

- Relationships between objects
- Aggregate methods (e.g., average price)
- A class method to find the top customer for a coffee
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
